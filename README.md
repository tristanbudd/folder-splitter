# How do I use this?
1. Install python. (No libaries required) [https://www.python.org/downloads/]
2. Configure settings.json with the source directory of where to grab the original contents for splitting, The amount of subfolders to split into and the names of each individual subfolders and the output folder path. (An underscore as well as a unique number is also added on the end when splitting folders)
3. Run the script, fix any errors and consider turning on debug mode to see which files are being moved where.

# What can it be used for?
Whatever you need really, simple modification can also allow for other methods such as splitting per amount of files e.t.c

I personally use this quite frequently to split up game mods into multiple similarly sized content packs so that the files can be uploaded to the Steam Workshop without surpassing the maximum upload size.
